# data-visualization-mini-project

When I was in childhood, I was very interested in seeing a film because movies represent dreams. The film industry is now more than a century old, but it still contributes to people. IMDb is the most popular database for movies. Due to more than 6 million movies being stored at IMDb, Amazon has owned this database since 1998. In this data visualization mini project, we utilize the dataset of IMDb to explore and discover some creative insight into the film industry. From 2004 to 2010, the film industry is the best period time in the history. We found that global movie gross income firstly proceeds from the US gross income. In other words, US movie income mainly came from the outside of the US market. Thus, we ask two questions which year and which month should have the highest average of US gross income between 2004 and 2010?![image](https://github.com/rmiaous/data-visualization-mini-project/assets/57642679/647cc486-14a2-4849-a348-c858ac764730)
